This package provides an easy way to build Wt and all its
dependencies, to try out the library and run its examples.

0. When checking out from git
-----------------------------

  $ aclocal
  $ autoconf

I. Building and installing Wt and its dependencies
--------------------------------------------------

To build Wt and all its dependencies, you need to run:

  $ ./configure --prefix=$PWD/install --with-wt-version=3.2.3
  $ make all

You can chose any wt version or 'git' for using the latest git development
version.

You can specify which version of boost to build, an optional BOOST_PREFIX, and a compiler mode (if your compiler supports it).

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/boost_1_59_0/wt-3.3.5  --with-wt-version=3.3.5-rc1 --with-boost-version=1_59_0 \
 BOOST_PREFIX=/usr/local/boost_1_59_0  WT_CPP_11_MODE=-std=c++0x


Running just 'make' will show the different targets

If you want to install Wt in a place that requires privileges, and do not
want to use these privileges when simply building, you can break it down in
the following parts:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/wt/
  $ make deps
  $ sudo make deps-install
  $ make wt
  $ sudo make wt-install

II. Running the examples
------------------------

To run one of the examples:

 ./run-example
 ./run-example mandelbrot
